Make a model for offer banner on home screen 
fields are
- offer_main_title
- offer_sub_title
- offer_image
- offer_redirection_url
- offer_active_date  
- offer_expire_date  max only 2 day --> offer_expire_date - offer_active_date < 3
- payment - done or not -- payment for puting own banner in MY website
- payment_price how much payment has done 


Make a controller that returns a cuttenly running offer 
    - domain => - payment is true
                - offer_main_title, offer_sub_title, offer_image, offer_redirection_url is not null
                - offer_active_date <= today <= offer_exprire_date
                
    - it should just return a 5 banner that are in this domain and has max payment_price

    for exmple 

    : all_Set_and_active_offer = offer_main_title, offer_sub_title, offer_image, offer_redirection_url is not null AND offer_active_date <= today <= offer_exprire_date

    offer   |      payment     |   payment_price       |      all_Set_and_active_offer
